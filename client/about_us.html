                    <p> The platform Acorn Nursery shall allow BYU-I students/faculty to sign in with their university
                        account to begin working on projects and post new ideas. For a project to be hosted
                        a student must have the required "Acorn's" (currency) amount to sponsor their idea. Once the
                        project is hosted, it shall show up on the platform's job board for
                        other developers to begin development. Acorns to sponsor projects can be earned from the
                        allocated cost that was
                        spent to create a job listing. Acorns shall be distributed across the projects required
                        features for development.</p>
